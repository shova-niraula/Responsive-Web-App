                            communication overload, important details can fall through the cracks, our people can feel
                            (and often are) unheard. We’re losing the opportunity to fortify relationships while

                            scientists, health professionals, scholars and sport professionals (Yeh, Churchill, Brymer &
                            Keith, 2017; Bellocco, Jia, Ye, Lagerros, 2010). It is widely accepted among scholars that
                            running brings energy and strength to muscles. The mental well-being after a run is also
                            well documented (Brown, Mishra, Lee & Bauman,
                            2000). What is sometimes overlooked or not discussed exhaustively enough are the internal
                            conflicting feelings runners experience during their runs including reflection, emotion,
                            ataraxia and exuberance and excitement experienced while running. Some of these feelings may
                            be opposite but they are amazingly experienced at the same time. The interesting aspect of
                            these feelings is the runner’s awareness of their presence while exercising or running.
                            These feelings have undeniable direct and indirect influences on the runner’s performance

                            meditation in the yoga tradition. We will review some of the techniques for preparing the
                            mind and body for meditation, as well as methods that can be used to deepen a meditation
                            practice. Whether you are a new or experienced meditator, you will benefit from having time
                            to explore the use of mindfulness, breathing, and relaxation in this workshop and leave
                            feeling calm, clear, and refreshed.</p>

                            mindfulness, the number of successful, high-profile people benefiting from these practices
                            continues to grow. So what exactly is it and how can you apply it to your life? In this
                            session, we will explore the real-world, practical benefits of learning to be more
                            “present”, and how this practice can sharpen your focus, reduce stress, improve
                            communication, and create a more positive work/life balance.</p>
