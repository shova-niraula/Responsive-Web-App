                                this posture. I prefer a shorter class today. Her Om is, well … still off-key to my

                                the richest countries in the world. So what’s the problem? The answer, according to
                                the recently released Social Progress Index, is that the United States is not
                                turning those positive economic numbers into basic improvements in the lives of
                                citizens” (Green, M., 2016). The real question is what do about this. How can we get
                                people to talk and truly listen to each other? Not from the perspective of
                                persuasion or convincing, but from the
                                perspective of understanding and learning? Restorative Practices might provide the
                                framework to start these conversations. This discussion will start by defining
                                restorative practices (RP), brainstorm some everyday uses of RP, and then concludes
                                by looking beyond the educational lens towards implementing a culture of RP within
                                organizational of all types.

                                to already crowded schedules. One workaround is to integrate mindfulness into core
                                courses that make up students’
                                degree requirements. This presentation will focus on the Communicating Mindfully (CM)
                                curriculum I created over twenty years ago to teach an introductory communication course
                                at NHTI—Concord’s Community College. CM has influenced curriculum development at the
                                college and in colleges and universities throughout the country and around the globe. It
                                serves as the foundational course for NHTI’s mindful communication certificate, which is
                                infused directly into three degree programs: information technology, human services, and
                                addiction counseling.
                                Anecdotal evidence, as well as pre-post-studies, suggest CM helps students—and
                                teachers—overcome challenges they face in college, at work, and in life in general.
                                During this presentation, I will explain the foundational logic of CM, lead participants
                                through a brief meditation used in the course, share results of studies we have
                                completed on the curriculum, explain how the course inspired the creation of the mindful
