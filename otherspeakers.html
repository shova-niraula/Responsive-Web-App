                        <p>Professor Huston teaches mindful communication and writing in the English Department at
                            NHTI—Concord’s Community College. He has been incorporating mindfulness, meditation, and
                            emotional intelligence in his communication curriculum for over twenty years and was awarded
                            NHTI’s 2008 Chancellor’s Award for Teaching Excellence. Huston is the author of the textbook
                            Communicating Mindfully: Mindfulness-Based Communication and Emotional Intelligence, which
                            has been adopted at numerous colleges and universities, as well as other publications on
                            mindful communication. His Communicating Mindfully course is required of students in several
                            degree programs at NHTI and strongly recommended for others. The course doubles as a form of
                            professional development for faculty, and it serves as the foundation of NHTI’s Mindful
